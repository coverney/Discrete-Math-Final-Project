# Discrete-Math-Final-Project

## Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, install jupyter notebook and Python 3 in your environment. A list of the packages needed for different scripts is included in the requirements.txt document.

## Data
The data for this project comes from Stanford's Network Analysis Project (SNAP). The first data set we used is the [Amazon Copurchases Dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0302.html), which has Amazon products (primarily books) as the nodes, and copurchases (products bought at the same time) as the edges. This dataset includes a list of copurchases based on their ASIN ID number, and a [meta data file](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html) which has the product information for all products involved. The second data set we used is the [email-EU-core network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core.html), which was generated from the email data of a large European research institution. The dataset includes incoming and outgoing emails between members of the research institution, and excludes outgoing and incoming messages to the rest of the world. Each node is a person, represented by an ID number, and there is an edge (u, v) in the network if person u sent person v at least one email.
